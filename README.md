# LeetCode and Codeforces Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to problems from LeetCode and Codeforces, which are popular online platforms for coding competitions and technical interviews.
## Structure

The repository is organized into two main directories:

### 1. [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/anas_na/) 
This directory contains my solutions to problems from LeetCode. Each problem is organized in its own directory with the problem name as the directory name. Inside each problem directory, you will find the following files:
* 'solution.py':This file contains my Python solution to the problem. The solution is well-commented and includes explanations of the approach and algorithm used.
* 'README.md': This file contains a brief description of the problem, along with any additional notes or insights I have about the solution.

### 2. [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/anas_na)
This directory contains my solutions to problems from Codeforces. Similar to the LeetCode directory, each problem is organized in its own directory with the problem name as the directory name. Inside each problem directory, you will find the following files:
* 'solution.py':This file contains my Python solution to the problem. The solution is well-commented and includes explanations of the approach and algorithm used.
* 'README.md': This file contains a brief description of the problem, along with any additional notes or insights I have about the solution.

## Usage

You can clone this repository and access the solutions for each problem in the respective problem directories. The solutions are written in Python and can be run using any Python interpreter or IDE.

Please note that these solutions are my personal implementations and may not always be the most optimal or efficient solutions. They are meant to serve as a reference and learning resource for understanding different problem-solving approaches and techniques.
